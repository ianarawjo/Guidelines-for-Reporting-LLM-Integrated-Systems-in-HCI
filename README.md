### Feedback and Discussion

We welcome community feedback. For comments, suggestions, or other feedback, please raise a Discussion or Pull Request on this GitHub repository. These guidelines were our best shot at distilling current best practices from a need-finding study with 18 "users" (authors and reviewers of such papers), iterated with six senior HCI researchers, but we don't claim they are perfect. Our paper also includes common pitfalls for reviewers of LLM-integrated systems, and some suggestions for HCI communities, which we ommitted from the website for now. Please see our work-in-progress paper for those details.
